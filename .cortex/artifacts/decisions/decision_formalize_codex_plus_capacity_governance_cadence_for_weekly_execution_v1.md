## Context
- Captured via `cortex-coach decision-capture`.

## Decision
Define PH0-007 capacity governance cadence with explicit /status/dashboard checkpoints, mandatory mid-week pressure downgrade behavior, and review-load guardrails tied to the current planning baseline.

## Rationale
Explicit cadence controls reduce limit-pressure regressions and protect governance gate discipline during multi-week execution.
