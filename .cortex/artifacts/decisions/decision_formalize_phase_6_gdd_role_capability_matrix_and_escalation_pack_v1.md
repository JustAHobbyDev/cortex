## Context
- Captured via `cortex-coach decision-capture`.

## Decision
Adopt a portable Phase 6 minimum role set with command-surface capability boundaries and escalation SLA matrix; require backup coverage and least-privilege command execution before external bootstrap pilots.

## Rationale
Bootstrap portability needs explicit, auditable operator/approver boundaries so multi-agent execution remains governable and fail-safe across new projects.
