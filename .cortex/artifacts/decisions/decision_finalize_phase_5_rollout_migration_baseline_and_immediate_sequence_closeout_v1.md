## Context
- Captured via `cortex-coach decision-capture`.

## Decision
Mark PH5-003 and PH5-004 complete with migration/handoff and cross-project reference evidence, and advance immediate next actions to PH5-005/PH5-006 reliability cycles while keeping default mode blocked.

## Rationale
Phase 5 baseline implementation is complete across contract, runtime, migration, and reference layers; governance sequencing should now move to reliability-cycle evidence.
