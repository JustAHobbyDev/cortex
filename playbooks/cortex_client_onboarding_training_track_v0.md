# Cortex Client Onboarding Training Track v0 (Moved)

Version: v0  
Status: Moved to external training project  
Date: 2026-02-25  
Scope: Compatibility pointer

The full client-onboarding training track content has been extracted to the standalone training project.

Use:

1. `docs/cortex-coach/client_training_external_repo_v0.md` for canonical training-project reference and pin policy.
2. `docs/cortex-coach/client_training_project_boundary_and_handoff_v0.md` for the integration boundary and handoff contract.
3. `contracts/client_training_project_handoff_schema_v0.json` for machine-checkable handoff manifests.

This playbook remains as a compatibility stub so historical references in `cortex` remain resolvable.
