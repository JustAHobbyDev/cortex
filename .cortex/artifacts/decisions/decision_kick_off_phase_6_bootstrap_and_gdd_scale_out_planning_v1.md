## Context
- Captured via `cortex-coach decision-capture`.

## Decision
Mistake observed: Phase 5 completion left expansion work without an explicit next-phase execution contract. Recurring pattern: After a phase closeout, roadmap continuation can drift unless the next phase has a ticket board and measurement baseline. Adopt reusable rule: Before starting post-closeout implementation, publish the next phase board + measurement plan and link it to the roadmap.

## Rationale
Promote durable, auditable learning so repeated mistakes are prevented across sessions.
