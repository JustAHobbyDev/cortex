## Context
- Captured via `cortex-coach decision-capture`.

## Decision
Mistake observed: Phase 4 baseline and governance roster updates were not yet codified as promoted decision-linked artifacts. Recurring pattern: Planning and governance updates can land quickly without explicit decision/reflection linkage for all affected control artifacts. Adopt reusable rule: When phase baselines or maintainer-governance mappings change, capture and promote a linked decision in the same change set.

## Rationale
Promote durable, auditable learning so repeated mistakes are prevented across sessions.
