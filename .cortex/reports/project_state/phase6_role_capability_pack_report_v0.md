# Phase 6 Role Capability Pack Report v0

Version: v0  
Date: 2026-02-25  
Status: pass  
Ticket: PH6-005

## Scope

Formalize minimum multi-agent GDD role set, command capability matrix, and escalation matrix for bootstrap-phase operations.

## Implemented Artifacts

1. `playbooks/cortex_phase0_role_charters_v0.md`
2. `docs/cortex-coach/README.md`

## Result Summary

1. Minimum required role set documented for Phase 6 bootstrap/GDD execution.
2. Command/capability matrix documented with operator and approval boundaries.
3. Escalation matrix documented with trigger, owner, target, and SLA.
4. Coverage invariants documented (backup coverage, least privilege, override linkage).

## Follow-On

1. Consume this matrix in PH6-006 bootstrap readiness harness checks.
2. Verify external pilot runs include explicit role-to-person mapping before execution.
