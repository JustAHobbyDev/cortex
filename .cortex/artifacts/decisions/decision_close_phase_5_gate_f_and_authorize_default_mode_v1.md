## Context
- Captured via `cortex-coach decision-capture`.

## Decision
Gate F metrics are satisfied for both required reliability cycles; adopt default rollout mode with reversible controls and audited transition evidence.

## Rationale
Phase 5 objectives are complete with two stable cycles, zero stop-rule incidents, pass adoption/overhead metrics, and complete transition-audit coverage.
