# Client AI Governance Fundamentals v0 (Moved)

Version: v0  
Status: Moved to external training project  
Scope: Compatibility pointer

Full curriculum content for this module now lives in the standalone training project.

Use:

1. `docs/cortex-coach/client_training_external_repo_v0.md` for canonical training-project reference.
2. `docs/cortex-coach/client_training_project_boundary_and_handoff_v0.md` for boundary and integration contract details.

This file is intentionally retained as a thin compatibility stub so historical references in `cortex` remain resolvable.
