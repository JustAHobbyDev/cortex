## Context
- Captured via `cortex-coach decision-capture`.

## Decision
Mark CT-005 complete with calibrated findings and carry command compatibility/bootstrap remediations into CT-006 gating scope.

## Rationale
Pilot evidence validates rubric strictness and exposes deterministic blockers that must be closed before client rollout.
