# Cortex

Cortex is a structured cognitive operating layer for high-leverage AI collaboration.

It is not a note system.
It is not a knowledge dump.
It is not a session archive.

Cortex stores distilled cognitive leverage — reusable structures that improve clarity, reliability, and execution speed across projects.

## What Cortex Contains

Cortex contains only high-signal, reusable artifacts:

* Principles
* Patterns
* Contracts
* Specs
* Templates
* Canonical Prompts
* Playbooks
* Policies
* Philosophical Positions
* Operating Model Definitions

Every artifact must:

* Increase structured thinking
* Improve agent reliability
* Be reusable across projects
* Reduce cognitive entropy

If it does not compound reasoning power over time, it does not belong here.

## What Cortex Does Not Contain

Cortex does not store:

* Raw sessions
* Chat logs
* Telemetry
* Checkpoints
* Project state
* Experimental exhaust
* Brainstorm dumps

Git history is sufficient provenance.

Cortex is a reasoning layer, not an activity log.

## Design Philosophy

Cortex exists to compound structured thinking.

It is optimized for:

* Clarity over accumulation
* Reusability over novelty
* Discipline over volume
* Architecture over tools

Cortex is a long-term cognitive multiplier.
